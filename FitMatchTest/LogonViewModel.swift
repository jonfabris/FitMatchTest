/*
    I would use OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens. The Logon screen would communicate to the server to do the authentication and return a token which would expire after a certain amount of time. The token can be stored on the deviceâ€™s keychain and if it has not expired they can restart the app without logging in again. You would also want to use multi factor authentication for extra security.
    All of this is what we did in my previous job, and it seems to be the best approach.
